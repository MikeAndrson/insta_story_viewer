### TODO
- Add more APIs to choose from (currently only anonstories.com is supported)
  - Or write our own backend using [instagrapi](https://github.com/subzeroid/instagrapi)?
- Save/download the story to storage

Contributions are of course appreciated but this app is mostly for my own use so don't take it too seriously lol
